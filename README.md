# CreateClass-script

This an simple but usefull script to create classes in C++. 
During the CPP module you need to write a lot of them! So this may be handy for you, feel free to use it:)

#### **Clone the repository**
```
  git clone git@github.com:steryu/CreateClass-script.git
```

#### **How to compile**
``` sh
./createClass.sh {class_name}
```
it will then create a {class_name}.cpp file and an matching {class_name}.hpp file.

The script is inspired by [Maia de Graaf](https://github.com/maiadegraaf/42-Ultimate-Orthodox-Canonical-Class-Creator), who made a more complicated script, this an simplified version.
